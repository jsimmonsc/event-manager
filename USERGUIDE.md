## Selling

A seller only has the ability to sell tickets to students. Here are the steps to check in students:

1.  Go to [capstone.psdr3.org](http://capstone.psdr3.org) and log in with a seller email.
2. On the events page, navigate to the event you are selling tickets for by clicking the event&#39;s green arrow button.
3. Type or scan in the student&#39;s ID number to pull up their information. The student&#39;s name, student ID number, and grade level should be displayed.
4. Depending on the requirements for attending the event, icons will also appear. A green check mark icon indicates that the student has no problems with that requirement. A red warning icon indicates that the student has fines or has insufficient attendance. If no icons appear, then the event does not have any requirements for attending.
5. Check the &quot;Student has a Guest&quot; checkbox below if the student is bringing a guest to the event and wishes to purchase their ticket.
6. By default, the system assumes that the guest attends Pattonville. If this is the case, enter the guest&#39;s ID number. The guest&#39;s information will appear in a similar format, and the system will also check if the guest meets the requirements for attending. Note: Guest ID numbers must be obtained from a printed spreadsheet.
7. If the guest does not attend Pattonville, uncheck the &quot;Guest Goes to Pattonville&quot; checkbox. A form will appear for the guest&#39;s name, school, phone number, and age. This is not a substitute for the physical form that the student fills out and submits to administration.
8. Click the green &quot;Submit&quot; button to register the student (and guest, if applicable). If either the student or guest has a problem with one of the requirements for attending, sellers will not be able to register the students as attendees.

## Checking In

A checker only has the ability to check in attendees at the event. Here are the steps to check in students:

1. Go to [capstone.psdr3.org](http://capstone.psdr3.org) and log in with a checker email.
2. On the events page, navigate to the event you are checking in by clicking the event&#39;s green arrow button.
3. Type or scan in the student&#39;s ID number to check them in to the event.

## Managing Events

An admin has full access to the system. Admins can sell tickets, check in, create events, and manage attendees. Go to [capstone.psdr3.org](http://capstone.psdr3.org) and log in with an administrator email.

**Event Information Page**

1. Admins can access the selling and checking in pages from the event information page by clicking the &quot;Sell&quot; and &quot;Check In&quot; buttons.
2. Press the plus icon at the top of the table to add an attendee.
3. Admins can edit or remove attendees in the table by clicking on the pencil icon next to each attendee.
4. Admins can edit events by pressing the circular green pencil icon in the top right corner.
5. The table of attendees can also be exported as a CSV with the &quot;Export to CSV&quot; button. This allows the list of attendees to be put into Excel and printed out.

**Admin Panel**

1. The admin panel is for managing users and is only accessible by admins and super users.
2. Press the plus icon at the top of the table to add a new user.
3. To change a user&#39;s role or remove the user, press the pencil icon next to each user. Super users cannot be edited.

**Create/Edit Events**

1. To make a new event, navigate to the &quot;Create Event&quot; page. Events are edited by navigating through the event information page (see Event Information Page).
2. All required fields must be filled in to submit an event. Note: The date must be written in the format of MM/DD/YYYY or M/D/YYYY. We strongly recommend using the date picker dialog for this.
